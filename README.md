Summary — Main Project: stock_market_prediction

For a more detailed look inside, see the stock_market_prediction folder, which contains its own README with further details.

This project consists of a set of Python programs that take as input data related to a financial underlying and generate new features from the limited available information, which consists of historical price and volume series.

The program then trains a machine learning model — XGBoost is recommended as the default choice — to classify each instance as “buy”, “hold”, or “sell” based on the derived features, taking appropriate precautions during model training to prevent overfitting.

Once properly trained, the model is saved and can be reused to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Finally, I implemented a backtesting module that evaluates the potential profits or losses resulting from following the trading signals generated by the model. The backtest is conducted exclusively on data not used during training to avoid bias and provide a realistic estimate of the model’s performance.





Files description (minor projects) :
1) Posterior_estimation.py: Uses a Bayesian framework to estimate an unknown parameter.
The script demonstrates how, within Bayesian inference, we can combine prior knowledge and observed data to make the best probabilistic estimate of the parameter.

3) Random_walk.py: Creates 95% upper and lower bounds for random walk processes, which will contain approximately 95% of future observations.
This program illustrates that, although it is impossible to predict the exact future of such processes, it is still possible to estimate their likely range of variation.

3) Portfolio_analysis.py: Performs standard portfolio analysis by calculating returns and standard deviations of individual positions and the overall portfolio.
The most interesting part is at the end, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to detect concentration of risk in the portfolio.
The script generates an alert if a large portion of the portfolio’s volatility is attributed to a few assets.
