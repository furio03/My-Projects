Files description top-down :

1) deploy_model.py : Deploy the best model and use it to make predictions on new datasets, so you donâ€™t have to retrain the model each time. The deployment also preserves the best parameters found during training, such as the k in K-Means and other model-specific hyperparameters, making the model ready for immediate use. Finally,shows the hypothetical profits or losses that would have been obtained by following the signals generated by the model.

2) main.py : Trains a machine learning model on the available data using k-fold cross-validation (I used k=10). It supports multiple models, though XGBoost is recommended because it can handle many input variables without requiring strong assumptions about their significance.
If you choose to use another model, it is also possible to assign different weights to different types of errors. For example, you could assign a weight of 1 if the model classifies an instance as hold when it should be buy, and a weight of 10 if it classifies a sell as buy. This allows you to penalize the model more heavily for the types of errors you want to minimize.
Finally, the program saves the best-performing model, displays its performance on a test dataset, and shows the hypothetical profits or losses that would have been obtained by following the signals generated by the model.
